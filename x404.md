# Sol X404
## Eth-X404
### [ERC404 Design Point](https://github.com/Pandora-Labs-Org/erc404)
1. Fully support ERC20/ERC721
2. One unit token bind to one NFT, NFT is circulated and mintable
3. ERC404 allows to transfer a specific NFT or a digital amount
4. NFT assigned according to balance is maintained through queue and transferred with priority.

### [XRGB-X404 Design Point](https://docs.xrgb.xyz/xrgb/x404-protocol)
1. Deposit
Anyone can add whitelist NFT assets, provide liquidity for NFTs, and receive a portion of the transaction fees subsequently.
2. different X404 Account (Seems not important if we all use mpl)
Each different type of NFT is an X404 contract, which is an extended ERC404 contract.
3. RedeemDeadLine (Lock of NFT supply)
After depositing NFTs, users will receive X404 tokens and can redeem their assets with priority within a specified period. After the redemption period expires, others can exchange for the assets by collecting a certain number of ERC404 tokens, which requires an extra transaction fee.

## Solana Concept

### SPL token
Standard for Fungible and Non-Fungible tokens. Can mint NFT or Fungible Token under same standard

### Transfer Hook

Token extension that allow specify a function to be triggered whenever a transfer is triggered.

## Proposal
### Instructions
1. Initiate
Input: Owner Pubkey, Redeem fee, max Redeem DDL
Functionality: Store Owner Pubkey, initiate global state, create fugible token mint account and NFT mint account.
2. Deposit
Input: NFT pubkeys, Redeem DDL, 
Functionality: Transfer NFT to program, store DDL and original owner with NFT, mint x404 tokens and transfer to user.

3. Redeem
Input: NFT pubkeys
Functionality: Check user has enough x404 for redeem fee and NFTs, Check Target NFT are all exceed DDL or it is the original owner. Pay the redeem fee with partial to original owner and burn x404 tokens for withdrawal the NFT.

4. Transfer Token Hook
Input: _from, _to, amount
Compute the balance of _from and _to and how many NFT they should have (exempt 0x0)
Mint or withdrawal NFT from _from and _to

4. Transfer NFT Hook
Input: _from, _to, NFT pubkey
Compute the balance of _from and _to and how many NFT they should have (exempt 0x0)
Mint or withdrawal NFT from _from and _to
